# async-cookies-api
Sketching an asynchronous JavaScript cookies API for documents and workers

At present the best starting point for understanding this API is [the explainer](explainer.md)

This is inspired by and loosely based on the discussion at https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/issues/707

The (currently out-of-date) document-based polyfill test is hosted here: https://bsittler.github.io/async-cookies-api/cookies_test.html
