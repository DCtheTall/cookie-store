    <p><b>Cookies:</b> this website uses HTTP cookies - small files stored on your
    computer and automatically sent with subsequent HTTP requests - to demonstrate and exercise
    an <a href="https://github.com/WICG/async-cookies-api">asynchronous cookie API for scripts</a> and
    may also use cookies for other purposes including but not necessarily limited to tracking your
    visits to this website and for correlation by third-party feedback and analytics providers.
    If you click or otherwise activate any buttons on this page you indicate your acceptance of and
    consent to all of this site's uses of cookies in your web browser now and in the future.</p>
    <button style="visibility: hidden" id="run-tests-button"><span id="tests-status-indicator"></span> Accept cookies and
    run tests</button>
    <p>This should be more interesting with the developer tools JS console open.
    At present this requires a recent development version of Google Chrome or Chromium with the Experimental JavaScript
    flag active - type <tt>chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony</tt> into the address bar to
    check the value of that flag and change it if desired.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/WICG/async-cookies-api/blob/gh-pages/cookies.js">document-based
    polyfill</a> included by this page runs best in an https page 🔒 - the polyfill
    is also usable but some tests fail when run in an unsecured http page 🔓 due
    to its reliance on <tt>Secure</tt> cookie access.</p>
    <button style="visibility: hidden" id="toggle-https-button"><span
    id="https-status-indicator"></span> Toggle https</button>
    <p>See <a
    href="https://github.com/WICG/async-cookies-api">https://github.com/WICG/async-cookies-api</a> for
    an explanation of the API.</p>
