    <p>This should be more interesting with the developer tools JS console open.
    At present this requires a recent development version of Google Chrome or Chromium with the Experimental JavaScript
    <tt>chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony</tt> flag active.</p>

    id="https-status-indicator"></span> Toggle https</button>
    <p>The document-based polyfill runs best in an https page ðŸ”’ - the polyfill
    is also usable but some tests fail when run in an unsecured http page ðŸ”“ due
    to its reliance on Secure cookie access.</p>
